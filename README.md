# Watermarking-medical-images-using-python
In this project, I developed a secure watermarking system for medical images to ensure the protection and integrity of patient data while sharing it with distant doctors and healthcare professionals. The primary goal was to embed a digital watermark into medical images in a way that preserves their quality while providing a layer of security against unauthorized access or tampering.
Key Features & Technologies Used:
Python & OpenCV: Used for digital image processing, watermark embedding, and extraction.
Tkinter: Developed a user-friendly graphical interface for seamless interaction.
Watermarking Technique: Implemented a robust and imperceptible watermarking algorithm to insert security markers without degrading the image's diagnostic quality.
Security & Data Protection: Ensured that patient information remains intact, traceable, and tamper-resistant while being shared over networks.
Project Impact:
Helps prevent unauthorized modifications to medical images.
Ensures authenticity and traceability of patient data.
Facilitates secure remote consultations between medical professionals.
